## Project Report 

## Reflection
This was a cool project that I really enjoyed working on it. Coming up with a game based on a theme was somewhat difficult, I really had no idea what to make with the "WE Fly" requirment. Eventually I settled on a doodle jump clone to try and keep it simple. This doesn't mean ut didn't come with problems. With these problems I learned a lot, such as applying force to a spevific area of a rigidbody.
